COMETS is a software platform for performing **computer simulations of
metabolism in spatially structured microbial communities**. It is based on
stoichiometric modeling of the genome-scale metabolic network of
individual microbial species (using dynamic flux balance analysis), and
on a discrete approximation of convection-diffusion equations.

COMETSpy is a Python package that provides a user-friendly interface to
COMETS. It allows users to easily set up and run simulations, and to
analyze the results. COMETSpy is designed to be used in conjunction with
COMETS. It is not a standalone package, and requires COMETS to be
installed on the user's computer.

This documentation is meant to aide users in installing COMETSpy and
using COMETSpy to run simulations and analyze the results. If you need
help and do not easily find an answer in this documentation, ask your question
in a `new issue on GitHub <https://github.com/segrelab/cometspy/issues/new>`_.
Any question that you have likely indicates a shortcoming in the documentation,
which we will want to fix!

The newest version of COMETS, which was developed as a partnership between
researchers at `Boston University <https://www.bu.edu/segrelab/>`_,
`Yale University <https://eeb.yale.edu/people/alvaro-sanchez>`_ and the
`University of Minnesota <http://www.wrharcombe.org/>`_ is fully described
in the following paper:
